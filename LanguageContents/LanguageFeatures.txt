LANGUAGE FEATURES:

-> Data types: Integer, Real, Boolean, String, Character, Record, Matrix (1D & 2D)

-> Operations for data types:
o Integer - addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, exponent, comparison.
o Real - addition, subtraction, division, muliplication, exponent, comparison.
o Boolean - equality check, logical not operation.
o Char - addition, subtraction, comparison.
o String - concatenation, length, character at position.
o Matrix - addition, number of rows and columns, accessing element
o Record - operation on elements based on data type mentioned above.

-> Functions:
o Allows more than one return values.
o Nested functions are not allowed.
o Basic data types - int, real, char, bool can be passed as arguments and returned from functions.
o Arguments are passed by value.
o Seperate section of function declaration to avoid confusion.

-> Scope rules:
o Static scoping.

-> Conditional Statement:
o If else statement with keyword: if, elif, else, endif.

-> Iterative statement:
o Loop structure: loop (intialize) (condition) (update): …. endloop.
o Allows programmers to define condition with break and continue statements.

-> I/O operations:
o get - gets the value of variable according to its data type from stdin.
o put - prints the value of variable, string literal, tab, newline to stdout.

-> Expression:
o Operator precedence same as C.
o Arithmetic operators : +, -, /, *, %, **(pow)
o Relational operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
o Logical operators: AND, OR, NOT

-> Assignment statement:
o Allows matrix and string initialization.
o Allows assignment of basic data types.

-> Strongly typed language.

-> Doesn’t support type conversion.

-> Same syntax for single and multi line comments:
o Syntax : /* Comment here */

-> Allows formatting code using tabs to improve readability of code.
